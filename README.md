# Ruby Hashes

## Instructions

Fork, clone, branch (training), `bundle install`

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Create a Ruby Hash using both the implicit (`{}`) and `new` constructors.
-   Assign a value to, modify, and delete a value in a Ruby Hash using a specified key.
-   Access a value in a Ruby Hash using a specified key.
-   Obtain an Array of keys from a Ruby Hash.
-   Explain why Symbols are preferred over Strings as keys in a Ruby Hash.

## Introduction

In Ruby, "A Hash is a dictionary-like collection of unique keys and their
 values".  In sharp contrast to JavaScript,
[Ruby Hashes](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Hash.html) are not the most general
 object in the language, but are instances of a specialized class for key/value
 storage.

## Ruby Symbols

A [Symbol](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Symbol.html) is a sequence of
 characters that is stored at most once in any instance of the Ruby interpreter.

In Ruby, strings are compared a character at a time, but symbols are compared by
 `object_id`.  This makes comparing symbols fast and therefore much more
 performant than strings when used as keys in a `Hash`.

### Demo: Test Equivalency

Each of the following pairs of operations are equivalent:

```ruby
> 'bob'.equal? 'bob'
=> false
> 'bob'.object_id == 'bob'.object_id
=> false
> 'bob'.eql? 'bob'
=> true
> 'bob' == 'bob'
=> true
```

But all of the following operations are equivalent:

```ruby
> :bob.equal? :bob
=> true
> :bob.object_id == :bob.object_id
=> true
> :bob.eql? :bob
=> true
> :bob == :bob
=> true
```

We can create a symbol with arbitrary characters if we surround the characters
 with quotes (either `:'<characters>'` or `'<characters>'.to_sym`):

```ruby
> :'&foo'.equal? '&foo'.to_sym
=> true
```

How does this compare to keys in JavaScript?

## Creating Ruby Hashes

Let's look at different ways to create a Hash.

### Demo: Hash Creation

```ruby
> apartment = {}
=> {}
> apartment = Hash.new
=> {}
> apartment = Hash.new('')
=> {}
> apartment[:address]
=> ""
> apartment[:address] = { street: '255 Long Road', city: 'Awesomeville'}
=> {:street=>"255 Long Road", :city=>"Awesomeville", :bedrooms=>3}
> apartment[:bedrooms] = 3
=> 3
> apartment.merge!({rent: 1000})
=> {:address=>{:street=>"255 Long Road", :city=>"Awesomeville"}, :bedrooms=>3, :rent=>1000}
```

Picking sensible defaults may not always be easy.

### Code Along: Hash::new

Let's use the different forms of [Hash::new](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Hash.html#method-c-new)
to create some hashes in `bin/code_along.rb`.

### Lab: Hash Shorthand

In [bin/lab.rb](bin/lab.rb) create a hash using the shorthand syntax for
assigning the keys `:sq_ft` `:pets_allowed` with a type-appropriate value
of your choice. Then assign a default of `[]` to the hash and make sure that
accessing non-existing keys return the default.

## Assigning and Accessing Elements in a Ruby Hash

### Demo: Accessing, Modifying, and Deleting

```ruby
> apartment[:occupants] = []
=> []
> lee = {name: "Lee", age: 24, dog: "Fluffy"}
=> {:name=>"Lee", :age=>24, :dog=>"Fluffy"}
> adrian = {name: "Adrian", age: 25, cat: "Scratchy"}
=> {:name=>"Adrian", :age=>25, :cat=>"Scratchy"}
> apartment[:occupants].push(lee, adrian)
=> [{:name=>"Lee", :age=>24, :dog=>"Fluffy"}, {:name=>"Adrian", :age=>25, :cat=>"Scratchy"}]
> apartment[:occupants][1].delete(:cat)
=> "Scratchy"
> apartment[:rent] += 150
=> 1150
```

### Lab: Appending

Add roommate Bo to `:occupants` in the hash in [bin/lab.rb](bin/lab.rb).
Append one or more properties of your choosing to the roommate objects, such as
`:job` or `:education`.

### Demo: Hash Keys

To get an Array of the keys that have been set in a hash, use `Hash#keys`.

```ruby
> apartment.keys
=> [:address, :bedrooms, :occupants, :rent]
```

### Lab: Hash.new Initialized With Default

What if we wanted to instantiate our new hash with this default right off the
 bat? Checkout the Ruby docs on [new hashes with default blocks](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.1/Hash.html#new-method).

Then, in `bin/lab.rb` initialize a new hash using `Hash.new` with a block that
 sets the default value (without using `.default`) of all keys to the string
`"Sorry, <keyname> does not exist".`
